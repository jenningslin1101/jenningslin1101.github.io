        <h2 class="home-header">UNC FOOTBALL</h2>
        <p>The North Carolina Tar Heels represent the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as student-athletes on the football field, in the classroom, and in their communities. The Tar Heels play in the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).</p>
        <br>
        <p>The program has long been overshadowed by the school’s powerhouse men’s basketball team. While not a consistent football powerhouse, the program has produced great standouts who have gone on to play in the National Football League (NFL) including Lawerence Taylor, Charlie Justice, Harris Barton, Jeff Saturday, Dré Bly, Julius Peppers, Mitch Trubisky, and Sam Howell.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Coached by Hall of Fame coach Mack Brown, the Tar Heels have a 9-3 record and are 6-0 on the road for the first time in program history. North Carolina is currently ranked #24 in the Associated Press Rankings and will play for an ACC championship title in Charlotte, NC this Saturday.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a program, the success of our team and our athletes is the utmost priority. Whether their next steps after graduation are the NFL or entering the workforce, we are here to support them with the resources necessary to succeed once they're done with their time here in Chapel Hill.</p>
